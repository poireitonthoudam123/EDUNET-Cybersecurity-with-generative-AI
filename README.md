EDUNET Cybersecurity with Generative AI

🚀 A Structured Learning Journey in Cybersecurity & Network Security

This repository highlights my progressive hands-on learning experience in networking and cybersecurity, completed through a structured three-week program. Each week builds upon the previous one, beginning with foundational networking, advancing into endpoint monitoring, and culminating in AI-driven intrusion detection. The objective of this journey was to gain both theoretical understanding and real-world implementation skills across modern cybersecurity domains.

📌 Week 1: Network Fundamentals with Cisco Packet Tracer
🔹 Overview

During Week 1, I explored core networking concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer. I designed and simulated a simple yet realistic network topology to understand how data travels between devices operating on different networks.

🔹 Network Architecture

The topology consisted of:

A Cisco 1941 router connecting two separate LAN networks

One LAN connected via a Switch (192.168.1.0/24)

Another LAN connected via a Hub (10.0.0.0/24)

Multiple end-devices configured with static IP addressing

🔹 Key Concepts Gained

IP addressing and subnetting

Router configuration and interface mapping

Functional differences between Hubs and Switches

Inter-network communication principles

Packet flow visualization and testing using ping

🔹 Outcome

I successfully enabled communication between devices across different networks, establishing a strong technical foundation in computer networking principles and routing operations.

📌 Week 2: Python-Based Keylogger System
🔹 Overview

In Week 2, I developed a Python-based Keylogger application to understand system-level monitoring from a cybersecurity perspective.

⚠️ This project was created purely for ethical learning and awareness regarding system security and user privacy.

🔹 Core Features

Real-time keystroke capture

Start/Stop monitoring control

Secure log storage

GUI built with Tkinter

Threading implementation for smooth execution

🔹 Technologies

Python

Tkinter

Multithreading

File I/O operations

🔹 Key Concepts Gained

Keyboard event interception

GUI application development

Thread-safe execution

Ethical security considerations

🔹 Outcome

This project enhanced my understanding of how monitoring tools operate and provided perspective on how such activities can be detected, mitigated, and ethically handled within cybersecurity frameworks.

📌 Week 3: AI-Driven Network Intrusion Detection System (AI-NIDS)
🔹 Overview

In Week 3, I designed and implemented an AI-based Network Intrusion Detection System capable of identifying malicious network activity — including attack traffic such as DDoS — using Machine Learning.

🔹 Solution Highlights

Random Forest classification model

Trained with real-world traffic from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset

Binary classification:

Benign traffic

Attack traffic

🔹 Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training, evaluation, and validation

Pandas & NumPy

Streamlit

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🔹 Key Concepts Gained

AI in cybersecurity analytics

Supervised learning techniques

Practical IDS workflow design

Model evaluation and optimization

Combining ML intelligence with rule-based security logic

Designing user-interactive security dashboards

🔹 Outcome

The final system demonstrates an effective AI-powered IDS model capable of identifying anomalous or malicious network behavior with strong accuracy — bridging theory with real-world application.
